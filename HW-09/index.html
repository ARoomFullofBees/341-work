were designed by Jim Henson. They are soft,

fluffy, and have furry feet.</p>

<p class="about"> Silkies are sweet,

sociable, and gentle birds who make great pets! They're great with children
Though bred mostly for their looks and personality, they are generally decent egg producers
usually laying one small egg every other day. They are excellent mothers and are used as surrogate brooders for
other breeds. They have blue skin and black bones. Also, they have 5 toes - which is unusual for a chicken.
Silkies are bantam (miniature) in size and very manageable for a novice.</p>
