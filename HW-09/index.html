<div class="ex1">Silkies look like they

were designed by Jim Henson. They are soft,

fluffy, and have furry feet.</p>

<div class="ex2">
<br>Silkies are bantam (miniature) in size and very manageable for a novice. They have blue skin and black bones. Also, they have 5 toes - which is unusual for a chicken. They come in both bearded and non-bearded varieties and in the colors: white, black, black, and splash.</div>

<div class="ex3"><p>Silkies are sweet,

sociable, and gentle birds who make great pets! They're great with children.
Though bred mostly for their looks and personality, they are generally decent egg producers
usually laying one small egg every other day. They are excellent mothers and are used as surrogate brooders for
other breeds. </p></div><br>
