<h1>Little Words</h1>
<h2> Poem by Dorothy Parker</h2>
<p>When you are gone, there is nor bloom nor leaf,<br>
Nor singing sea at night, nor silver birds;<br>
And I can only stare, and shape my grief<br>
In little words.

I cannot conjure loveliness, to drown<br>
The bitter woe that racks my cords apart.<br>
The weary pen that sets my sorrow down<br>
Feeds at my heart.

There is no mercy in the shifting year,<br>
No beauty wraps me tenderly about.<br>
I turn to little words- so you, my dear,<br>
Can spell them out.
