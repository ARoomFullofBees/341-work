# Week Three

After having a hard time with the first week, I'm glad this week went a lot more smoothly.

I started by:

- Reading through the classwork.

- Reading the assigned book pages.

- Making my first web page.

- Changing my repository to a web page.

I couldn't see my webpage at first and posted about it on the issues section. It was an easy fix; I simply hadn't added a zero in the address to access my week-03 assignment.

Next:

- I responded to a classmate over a naming and moving question that I had had dealt with in a different way than was previously suggested.

- I added a poem to my website.

However, I needed more page breaks to make the formatting right.

- I went back and added more page breaks.

Then:
- I created my read me markdown.
