      <h1> Ingredients:</h1>
      <ul>
    <li>1 pound of sugar</li>


    <li>4 pounds of stemmed cherries. </li>
    <ul><li>If the Cherryes are not Rype, that they are Green even a Bit, they will be so Sour that they will cause <strong>Stupefaction</strong> to your Teeth.</ul>
    <h1>Also Needed:</h1>

    <li>1 clean stick</li>
    <li>1 clean cloth</li>
    <li>1 copper pot</li>
  <ul>
      <li>Pot can be of another metal if jelly isn't intended for clairvoyance purposes.</li>
      <li>A candy thermometer is also recommended for <del>non-alchemically correct</del> version.</li>
</ul>
<li>1 Jelly Jar</li>
</ul>
<h1> Instructions</h1>
<ol>
<li> Take Cherryes the most Beautiful & most Rype that can be found, in the quantity you wish, and remove the Foot. </li>
<li> Take Sugar that is Nice & put it in coarse Powder & place in a Pan & it should have weight of two Pounds.</li>
<li> Take Cherryes that you have removed the Foot, the Weight of Six or Seven Pounds, and Grate and Rub them Coarseley with Clean Hands.</li>
<ul>
   <li>This <em>must</em> be done with bare hands and not a utensil.
</li> </ul>
<li> Place in the Pan where the Sugar is and place on the Fire to Boil until Half, moving with a clean Stick. </li>
<li> And when they have so Boiled you will Pour them through a Clean and Tight Cloth. [until] all has been well pressed and that only the Bones & Bark remains. </li>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep away from giving it too much fire as it would go over or burn itself </b> as it is better for the Jelly to be a little Green than too Cooked: because when Stored its Sugar makes it Dry. </ul>
</li>
<ul>
<li> When you will see that it is Cooked, that is a drop put on Marble, the drop remains tight and Round without Falling neither here nore there, or placed on a piece of tin or on a Knife or Glass the drop will be <em> as Vermillion as a perfect Claret Wine.</em></li>
</ul>
  <li> When it is Cooked you will put it in little Jars of Glass or Wood like you would Quince Jelly.</li>

<li>And when your Jelly will be Colde and Tight, you will have a Mode and Type of Jelly that you can't have Better Jelly of Cherryes, nor more Excellent in Beauty and Goodness.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  <em>and if afterwards you look through the Sun's light you will find it as Beautiful as a Ruby. You have to show or give to some great Prince or high Lord when they will be angry with the Heat or otherwise altered they will find the Jam hearty & Delicious & Without Defects. And if you do it like I have put on Paper, undoubtedly you will do a Jelly in all Perfection. </em>
