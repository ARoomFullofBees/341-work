<p> It was once believed that the colourful eye

design (also known as an eyespot) on certain

types of butterflies such as the Buckeye, Blue Pansy, Hawk Moth, and

others were a defensive adaptation.</p>

</div>

<div class="textblock">
  <p>Scientistists presumed the eye-like pattern was

meant to mimic predators such as owls, snakes,

and foxes in an attempt to disuade the

predators of butterflies - generally smaller

birds, toads, lizards, and rats from attacking

them. This method had been considered an

innocent act of evolutionary self-defense. However, new evidence suggests these "false" butterfly eye designs are completely operational in other

dimensions.</p>

  <p> Harvey Dashwood, President of the Universe Wide

Astral Projection Society, states: "It has been

well-known amongst astral travellers that the

so-called false eye design on butterflies is,

infact, a fully operational eye. It has often

been used to keep tabs on the citizens of this

realm. Whether or not the information being

gathered is used for diabolical purposes is

still unknown. Many suggest the gathered

information has been used for centuries as

market data for advertising purposes."</p>

  <p> Meanwhile, people are being discouraged to

invite the suscpicsious creatures into their

gardens."Don't plant flowers!" is the advice from the

National Security Council. "Until we know what

we're dealing with, avoid butterflies at all

costs," they warn.</p>
  <p> Authorities are looking further into the matter and now

examining other species that use mimicry. The Head of Defense says, "We are

currently investigating leaf bugs as well; we're

terribly afraid they might actually be leaves."</p>
